django-big-projects-watch - Documentation
=========================================

Django Big Projects Watch (BPW) is an **open source CMS** build with ``Python/Djano`` for the **civic oversight**
of **big publicly funded projects**, you can find the source code on 
`GitHub <https://github.com/holgerd77/django-big-projects-watch>`_.

BPW can be used by transparency activists and others to easily build and
maintain a representable project watch website for the interested public to get a better understanding
about the evolution of different parts of a project, a view of who is acting with what purposes and how
project goals changed over time.

.. note:: Sorry, *screenshots* provided are in *german* at the moment, I hope they are useful anyway 
          and give at least an impression of the system.

.. warning:: This software is still ``pre-alpha``, so it's not quite ready for production use.
             You should be able to install and test the software without problems though.
             Await a production ready ``alpha`` version around September/October 2012.
